\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online search. 

The ACM Computing Classification System --- \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of classifiers and concepts that describe the computing discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source. 

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for all short- and full-length articles, and optional for two-page abstracts.

% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and the bibliography file.
