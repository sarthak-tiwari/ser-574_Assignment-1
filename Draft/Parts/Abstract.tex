With the boom in the use of agile process model, imperfect implementations of agile are frequently being seen, out of which the problem of inter-team communication in agile teams is one of the most common issue.

This causes problems when the integration of end-products of different teams is carried out.
In this paper we have taken a detailed look at this problem and how we can mitigate this.
